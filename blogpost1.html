    As it stands, the carbon credits marketplace is disjointed, disorganized, and confusing. Differing types of offsets are sold for wildly varying prices, while their differing effects are sparsely documented. Additionally, various competing authentication and quality control standards are used depending on the source of the offset.

    Standardizing carbon offsets into a singular decentralized network of transactions on the blockchain could help alleviate some of the growing problems the market is facing. In fact, the market is set to enter a period of dramatic price growth and fluctuations as demand soars with companies striving to keep up with ambitious personal goals and legal caps. On-chain carbon transactions would make companies' sustainability initiatives transparent, prevent the double selling of credits, and keep transaction fees low. 
  
  
  Perhaps more fundamentally, there is a clear problem with carbon offset projects being poorly designed causing the number of carbon credits issued to be severely overstated. For example, providing clean cookstoves to communities of people traditionally cooking on open fires is a common project undertaken to produce carbon credits. The expected outcome is that communities will transition to cooking on devices that produce significantly fewer carbon emissions. However, it was found that carbon emissions may have actually increased as people began to run both types of stoves at the same time instead of just the cleaner cookstove. 
  
  
  Web3 hype? Undoubtedly.
